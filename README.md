#### I am Pablo GÃ³mez, a chemical engineer who found his passion in programming and Data Science. I am currently looking for projects and my first job in the IT area. I have work experience in engineering mostly with a business orientation. Every day I try to learn something new, a new tool, a new algorithm, a new method of doing things.
